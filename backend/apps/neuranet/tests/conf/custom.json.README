# Custom.json Conventions:
Custom.json is the place where we can write customised testcases based on the testFiles.
Currently Custom.json has some testcases but we can edit the cases according to the need.
One can also create a new json file for testcases with the same convention and use it for testing. And for this we just have to edit the costumFileName in test_custom.js(currently "custom.json");

## Structure:
```
      {
            "testcases": [
                  // here {....} represents one operation or one testcase
                  {
                        "ingest": ["english_doc_path"], // testname: "argv[0] argv[1] argv[2]......"
                        "aisearch": ["english_query"]
                  },
            ]
      }
```

## Description
- Every index of testcases({...}) represents an individual testcase.
- The keys of each test case represent the operation to be performed, such as aiingest or aisearch.
- The corresponding values are arrays of arguments (argv) required to execute the respective test file.

## ARGVs for Custom Test
1. argv[0] = testname ("custom" in this case) {required}
2. argv[1] = CSV_Report_file_name (Ex: report.csv) {optional, if not provided use a default naming convention for file creation}.
3. argv[2] = PATH_to_save_generated_CSV_Report (Ex: /home/deep/Download) {optional, generates the reports in the tests directory if not provifded}.

# Common Convention for All test Files:

## Parameters / ARGVs / file Conventions
- Every file name must follow this naming convention "test_<testname>.js", testname is the name of the test we need to perform for example: aisearch the the filename will be "test_aisearch.js".
- For input file, we just have to provide the filename with extension like:  example.pdf and this file must be present inside the "assests" folder of "tests directory". We can drop multiple files in the assests and then use for testing.

## Note:
For test files: {
      test_nodesqlparser.js, 
      test_sandox.js, 
      test_tfidftest.js, 
      test_vectoringest.js, 
      test_vectorsearch.js, 
      test_webcrawl.js 
} requires fullPath of files because these are not edited yet to support fileName instead of fullPath.
